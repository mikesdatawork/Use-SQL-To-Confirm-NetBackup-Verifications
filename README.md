## About-Process

 
<p>You can get a list of all the files that Netbackup has successfully copied by using the BPLIST utility. Ordinarilly this is run from Powershell or Command prompt, but it can be run using SQL, and the results can be pulled into a table, and you can build a process around it if needed. Thats exactly what I did here. </p>   
 
   
## SQL-Logic
```SQL
1	exec master..xp_cmdshell 'C:\NetBackupList\bplist -R 99 -C MyServerName.MyDomain.com -s 06/23/2018 00:00:00 -e 07/24/2018 00:00:00 -I "F:\BACKUPS"'

```


In order for this backup process to work you'll need to copy the Netbackup BPLIST utility to a root folder. In this example I am using the root of C:. I created a folder called NetBackupList, and there is where I copied the BPLIST utility and all the corresponding DLL's.
You can see the BPLIST.exe utility (in red) along with all the DLL's (in blue). Again; you can use any folder you want, but it would be much easier if it's a root folder, and the folder name has no spaced. This probably shouldn't be in Drive C:, but in this example it works well.

In this example; the BPLIST utility is found here under:
C:\Program Files\VERITAS\NetBackup\bin

 
Here's all the files you'll need to copy in order for the BPLIST.exe utility to work.
bplist.exe
libnbbase.dll
libnbclient.dll
vrtsLogFormatMsg_3.dll
vrtslogread_3.dll
vxACE_6.dll
vxcPBX.dll
vxicudata_6.dll
vxicui18n_6.dll
vxicuuc_6.dll
vxlis_3.dll
vxul_3.dll

![See Standared BPLIST Utility Dlls]( https://mikesdatawork.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/image002.png "See Standard BPLIST Utility Dlls")
 
When writing this process the firs thing you need to do is parameterize the BPLIST statement by creating variables that you can plug into it. You can see how I'm doing that below. The next thing is create a series of lists. A list of all backups that have occurred through SQL internal tables which is captured from BackupMediaFamily (splitting the path name from the file name), and using the path to run the BPLIST utility against every known backup path, and then taking the results of that and comparing the path list that BPLIST shows you against the database backups you are holding locally. Next you concatinate a Delete statement to run against only the files that were confirmed (using the BPLIST output), and you have a cleanup script which removes only the files that have already been backed up by Netbackup.
